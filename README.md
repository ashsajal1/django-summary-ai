# Django Summary AI Model

## Overview

The Django Summary AI Model is a project that utilizes Django, a high-level Python web framework, to build a web application that generates summaries of text using an AI model. The AI model employed in this project leverages natural language processing techniques to extract key information from text inputs and produce concise summaries.

## Features

The Django Summary AI Model offers the following features:

1. Text Summarization: The web application accepts text inputs and applies the AI model to generate summaries of the provided text.
2. User Interface: The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input text and view the generated summaries.
3. Multiple Summarization Options: Users can choose from different summarization algorithms or models to suit their needs.
4. Customization: The project allows customization of the AI model and integration of other NLP libraries or techniques.
5. Scalability: The Django framework enables easy scalability, allowing the application to handle a large number of users and text inputs.
